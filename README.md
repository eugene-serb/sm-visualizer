# Sort Methods Visualizer
Sort Methods Visualizer in ***JavaScript*** and ***HTML*** with ***CSS*** **[[rep](https://github.com/eugene-serb/sm-visualizer), [site](https://eugene-serb.github.io/sm-visualizer/)]**.

This program needed to visualise array sorting algorithms. Written just for learning. Yes, it's so primitive. Yes, YouTube and many of books for learning about coding and algorithms exist.

List of what this has and can visual:
1. ***Bubble sort classic***;
2. ***Bubble sort with a flag***;
3. ***Shaker (Cocktail) method***;
4. ***Gnome method***;

Later may be i'll add other methods.
